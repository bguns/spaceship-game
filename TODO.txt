TODO
====

Lines:

- Generate line vertices based on given sequence of points
- Rounded/tapered corners for lines

Glyphs:
- When drawing a glyph, if there is already a glyph cached with a very similar px_scale (%-based?), select that glyph and scale the texture, instead of caching an entirely new glyph
