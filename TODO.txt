TODO
====

General:
- Allow for rendering of polygon lines (wireframe) instead of fill, for debug purposes.

Lines:
- Indexed drawing of lines
- Add functionality to allow for looping line segment (last point connects to first point)
- Animate a moving multi-line
- Rounded/tapered corners for lines

Glyphs:
- When drawing a glyph, if there is already a glyph cached with a very similar px_scale (%-based?), select that glyph and scale the texture, instead of caching an entirely new glyph
